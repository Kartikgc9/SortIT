Phenomenal
He seemed nervous
Wow that script was crap
he was good for the role. now get ready for marvel to ruin all of it with doom
bro is literally tony stark
Now, let&#39;s see his audition for Doctor Doom...
I mean he&#39;s already growing the facial hair here. Screen testing
she hot
Looks he was auctioning for Tony Montana
This was almost 20 years ago
Why he look like AI?! I know it’s not but he was much younger here maybe they put makeup on him? Definitely crazy how fast time goes.
Who is the girl ?
WOW....powerful...and only the audition
I&#39;m just impressed how they can memorise their lines. How do actors that have terrible memories pass auditions?
Trading 1 titanium suit for another, so technically he&#39;s still &quot;Iron Man&quot; 😂😂😂
Yawn
Ai will never replace this
looks like ai generated
I wonder what other actors auditioned for the role.
Did he get the role?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfdXFbB-1oo&amp;t=246">4:06</a> Kevin Hart?
Tony Stark was BORN to play Rober Downey Jr. 😂
This guy can think on his feet
fine ill rewatch every ironman movie
Audition Sucks
I want that roadie scene in the Final Cut.
Next time, post the video without the FU*KING FILTERS!  It just looks fu*king weird...
Acting better in the rehearsal than the actual movie
This isn’t Robert Downey jr this is Tony stark
Dude auditions to be a billionaire...<br> Becomes billionaire lol
That’s not an audition, it’s a TEST
He is good
Not bad.... we&#39;ll try a few more and get back to him
You can tell he&#39;s a little nervous, his breathing is shaking.
You just can&#39;t keep the eyes off him. He&#39;s got too much charisma for his own good.
He&#39;d have been great as Tony Stank.
An r rated version of a stark night would be hilarious.  All the shit you couldn&#39;t say otherwise lol.
Not an audition. It&#39;s a test shoot. You would think a channel called FilmSnippets would know the difference.
Less than Zero
Crazy acting
Tony Stark is Robert Downey Jr.😊❤💛🔥👍
Is that Jon Michael Hill as Rhodey? He was fresh off various stage productions at this point.
&quot;I&#39;m Batman...&quot;
Back when they had good writing
the first few scenes he seems uncertain but by the end he&#39;s tony stark
Proof that practice is everything he completely mastered this role even though somewhat shaky in the beginning still really good though
Now all we need is his Dr. Doom audition clip 🤔
Sometimes I forget that he is an actor.😂😂😂
crazy.
Looked like he was going for Bogart.
You can tell he was a bit nervous.
Damn, makes want to start Iron man again and continue to End Game! 😄
R.D.J. is not playing Tony Stark, He is Tony Stark himself... He can not be someone else.. He can not be dr. Doom or whatever...
The Manhattan project did not help defeat the Nazis at least not directly.
The Manhattan Project that helped defeat the Nazis? It&#39;s very obviously Hollywood.
This is a screen test. smh
plot twist: this is real tony stark from another universe. and MCU send deadpool to make footage of TS to make movie with RDJ
&quot;What a you got? What&#39;s getting you through the cold nights, huh? Don&#39;t ask don&#39;t tell?&quot;<br><br>😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
This guy has a future!
makes you realise how many breaths they have to cut out of the sound
One thing I&#39;ve noticed in these various audition videos is how soft the actors seem to speak. Shows how close the mic is or perhaps compression used in the actual production vocals.
In the second shot I thought it was a blooper I legit didn’t even realise he was acting. Incredible.
its<br>not<br> him
GODAMN
Wait, Tony Stark is an actor?
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23freedom">#Freedom</a> I Want Tests
Disney is sitting on a gold mine, yet they choose to bury it.
RDJ = TONY STARK<br>TONY STARK = RDJ<br>Nothing else.
Was the last actor opposite RDJ Jones from White Collar?
Should be Iron Man Audition For Robert Downey Junior
He is tha man
These are test shots. Not audition tape.
isnt that exactly how the scene played out? 😂
You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villian….
Was that reporter Cortana? I swear it was
I never noticed how much breathing they cut out of dialogue till now.
So! Fxxking! Young!
Is this AI generated or what?
RDJ was also good as a black man.😂
Was that Sasha Alexander as the reporter?
Bro, am I the only one who thinks he sucked in these?
He really had the character there already
That last scene should&#39;ve made the final cut.
Definitely unpolished but he nailed it by the time it came to filming!
5 years later: &quot;We need to reign ourselves in....&quot;
this isn&#39;t an audition, RDJ hasn&#39;t had to audition in years, this is a screen test just to confirm to the suits that he is the guy, he had the part already
I cant memprize peoples name s right after they give it to me. This guy!!
Shows how good an actor RDJ is 👍
Can we give some props to the lady that played the journalist for holding her own in the scene?
Does anyone know when the IRON MAN will be released?
Who else was in the running?
would be interesting to watch other actors for this role
I&#39;m iron man and sheeeeeeiiit
Why’s YouTube different now when you minimize video
So much about Tony Stark, people forget he delivered an outstanding performance as Sherlock Holmes
&quot;I feed the good dog&quot;<br>Dig that
He is Tony 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Auditions for Ironman, gets Dr. Doom.
I wanna see Tony stark play Robert Downey Jr 🙃
Who’s the woman in the first audition ? Lisa Edelstein ?
Little does he know that one day he&#39;ll snap his fingers and save the world.
Bit snorty there coke face
Would’ve been nice if RDJ got the role!
I just not a fan of his acting style.
Can you do a compilation of auditions for the other Avengers? That would be cool!!
He’s got potential
This looks ai generated
Arguably the greatest casting in the history of modern cinema.
His performance is so wooden
Power supply - most important part. why cut it.?
Hes just a genius
while watching I felt like something was off, I was missing something <br><br>than I realize, it&#39;s the goatee
He looks so skinny here. I wouldn&#39;t have recognized him tbh. He reminded me a bit of Al Pacino tbh, especially in the 2nd clip.
That&#39;s why He is Tony Stark!
This wasn&#39;t an audition this was just RDJ speaking on Tuesday
I need to rewatch iron man series again
Bro got to rizz up a shorty to become  iron man
MotherFU- he just woke up and said “You know what? I AM Tony Stark.”
I can&#39;t wait to see him as Iron Man!! Goosebumps!
He thanos snapped disney&#39;s earnings so hard they had to have him back
Is that Sharif Atkins reading for Rhodey?
He was made for the role.
RDJ at the rock bottom of his life
why does it look like he&quot;s looking next to her and not at her ?
ok but the guy from white collar would have been an incredible Roady
He is slurring a lot, was he drinking on set?
he&#39;s so good.
He was taller, younger and wittier
I am still thinking how russo brothers get this man out of our minds as a Iron Man <br>And how we accept him as <br>Victor von doom<br>But for me i always<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23lovehim3000">#Lovehim3000</a> ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
There are no other Tony than Tony himself, RDJ is the definition of Tony Stark
RDJ the fuqnn GOAT 🐐❤‍🔥
He keeps flashing a glimpse at the camera.
RDJ is why they can&#39;t reboot Iron Man until 3 billion people are in nursing homes.
He IS Iron Man!!!
&quot;You get first dibs on the petting zoo&quot;😂
❤❤❤
I&#39;m glad he got the role but he sounds terrified lol, this role must have been a big deal or something
The rest was history ❤
Iron Man Audition for Robert Downey Jr.
Legend tony stark
Sounds much deeper here than his actual voice and performance as Stark.
Was that lady standing in a hole?
How many subscribers you got on this video ?
One day, one day RDJr  was good as an actor and a person. Completely socialist woke
❤❤❤
He is born to take this role
Am I imagining it or did he snort some cocaine before this audition
I still want another Sherlock Holmes movie.
Dr.Doom
I didn’t realize he already foreshadowed his role in Oppenheimer when he said his father was involved in the Manhattan Project 🤯
Send these to Marty Scorsese 😆
It’s crazy this was around the same time he played a dude disguised as another dude 🤣
There will never be a better Tony Stark than RDJ.
Who else auditioned?
Who’s the actress
Just by his breathing you can tell he was nervous but damn he is good as Tony
Just by his breathing you can tell he was nervous but damn he is good at tony
This the Canon Event
Tony stark having a hard time being RDJ
i didnt even know he was acting at first in the second clip... until they called him stark
Jeez how did he get the role! He&#39;s half asleep, really flat.
Hope he gets the role
This guy might do...<br>They should give him a chance 😂
Imagine if he accidently pooped his pants in the big moment. Would he have still gotten the role? If he had pooped his pants in that big moment.
did he get the part? 😃❤️
Hope he gets the job.
This is a screentest not an audition
gud job robert down syndrome jr
This is a test not an audition. He was already hired at this point.
They hadn&#39;t quite found the line between douche and cheeky huh
goat
It sounds like he’s playing into Tony Starks more drunk angle they went for in Iron Man 2. I used to hate that movie but now it’s really grown on me with just how goofy the MCU got that Iron Man and a dude with Electric Whips is fairly tame.
Noooo idiots, this is for Dr. Doom 😅
Is that him breathing or the camera guy?
How did he remember all the dialogues in a single shot!
Jeez, is the audition the hardest scene to shoot in the movie? Smart idea.
Who is the lady?
Not preparing for the audition.<br>Not a good plan.
Honestly instane to think of Tony stark as anyone else
I think he&#39;s gonna get the role
this man isn&#39;t human
Nah, this guy is not gonna make Iron Man stick..
Let us see how he audition in dr.doom
Ah damn, they should have kept him for the Ironman role!
He deserved the Oscar for Oppenheimer, what an actor
iron man is my idol
wow america, your pro militarism propaganda is gross
Rdj is Tony Stark. <br>I won’t ever see him as Doom.
whoever watch the audition and made that decision..God bless u
Robert Downey Jr was born for the role.
those eyes know where to go
Hardest thing of acting is not laughing, that why they pay millions to this guys.
Going to be interesting and oh so meta when the soldiers ride with Dr Doom, ask for a selfie, and he sneers.  That happened in the comic as an homage to Iron Man, they have to do it in the movies.
This was the second take. The first take still had a syringe still stuck in his arm
THE MAN, THE MYTH, THE LEGEND
Robert Downey Jr. ❌ <br>Tony Stark ✅
why is this getting released now?
The lines are so hard... I cannot learn a simple cauchy&#39;s integral formula. 😂
I don’t know what our world would be like if he didn’t make this
Он хороший актёр<br>Он играет! <br>Сегодня в роли Старка невозможно представить другого  актëра
Imagine if this guy actually gets this role
They should have chose someone else tbh he looks old and not giving superhero vibes sorry
I have to be honest, i think he is feeling nervous and this is unrefined. However he nailed the final product as we all know.
HE IS MORE THAN THE WORD &quot;PERFECT&quot;.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23rdj">#RDJ</a>
tbh I wouldn&#39;t have hired him on the basis of this audition. He just looks disinterested! Must have perked up on subsequent auditions.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfdXFbB-1oo&amp;t=250">4:10</a> is that Sharif Atkins?
The GOAT...
This guy should get the role
i started to wonder this tony stark character. who born first the role or the actor.
He is IRON MAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Communication while looking inside another person&#39;s eye or say it soul, is really difficult. In reality though and while acting I believe it would be crazy difficult. It&#39;s like speaking nothing out of the real world and speaking as if everything said is true. Maybe like believing with confidence in a fictional character and being it.
This is not good
The eyes technique...specially last scene.
WHATTTTTTTTTT?????? <br>IRON MAN ISN&#39;T REALLLLLLLLLLL???? <br>THIS IS  WHAT YOU ARE TELLING ME?????
who&#39;s the lady? she&#39;s equally good. no one commenting on thaaat???
This screen test will also double up for Doctor Doom
this guy has the potential to play tony stark
cant tell if he changed that much by the shooting time or if it was the magic of the good directing and lighting and filming ?
Show us his audition for dr doom
I think you guys should hire him
This was actually pretty flat...
I don&#39;t get how did he get the job?
Such a talent.
Iron Man Audition For Robert Downey Jr
Comes across a bit like a sarcy Bond
Idk he seems decent. I guess they should give him a shot.
Don&#39;t tell me it&#39;s CGI
this guy has more charisma in his pinkie than most people have in their entire bodies
A legend was born.
Bruh...he was born to play Tony Stark
I gotta re-watch the entire Ironman plus Avengers he&#39;s in.
💯💯💯
It&#39;s difficult to imagine anyone playing Tony Stark other than RDJ. I was initially skeptical when they announced that he had been given the part. Anyone can play Iron Man, but the man inside the suit, most actors will ruin it, and Marvel will never be the same as it is now.
I’m convinced they just had him walk in and talk to random casting directors
Man did change the volume A LOT from screen test to actual movie. He&#39;s talking like a villain here, it&#39;s quite a strange combo.
when a level 9999 person comes for an audition
I don&#39;t understand how they remember the lines
What a legend
Rdj is like that
this is also his audition for Doom...
He reminds me of O&#39;Neill from Stargate SG1 😂
I thought Iron Man portrayed his role as Tony Stark really well.
🤌🤌🤌🤌
Some actors are just born to play a role.
We want audition tape of RDJ for Dr Doom
The breathing lol.
“Guys….i think we found our guy”
You can see how much calmer and softer he speaks here. I don&#39;t know if it was the direction or his confidence raising after being confirmed for the role, but the Tony we got at the end is a cocky billionaire. What I see here is a smooth mad scientist.
Didn’t know Jamie Foxx was on set
Back before marvel was capeshit
小勞勃道尼的一生，造就了東尼史塔克，傳奇
wait a second......Is that Sasha Alexander...????
Damn.. nothing much has really changed except his tone and volume of voice.
This guy looks a lot like the actor who is playing doctor doom.
I can’t see anyone else playing Tony stark
And the rest was history…
this is AI btw
We&#39;re so accustomed to seeing pure greatness from the Tony Stark character that we take for granted just how far RDJ has come. Such an absolute gold find.
Crazy I didn’t even know he was acting in the second take😳
Is that Sasha Alexander playing the reporter in the first half?
AGENT JONES????
i have never seen an audtion play out so well. no wonder they fought so hard for him. he IS tony stark
Does anyone know where you can find just Audition Tapes for upcoming and past movies?
Meh. He would be a great Doctor Doom though.
This auditon. Change the course of disney for like 20 years
I don&#39;t think he&#39;s good enough to get it.
man doesn&#39;t blink
Bro&#39;s aura is unmatched...
This must have been before Elon Musk gave him a tour 😅
I will miss Mr Stark!
This is rehearsal not audition.
This audition sucks, this guy will never Iron Man😂😭
Willing to bet the director&#39;s only notes were: &quot;Like that, but play up the arrogance and cockiness more.&quot; and RDJ just ran with it
HE IS TONY STARK - His nickname is Robert Downey Jr
From this to now <b>Dr Doom</b> RBJ just as it. Gifted ❤
While filming, I bet the directors were like: “guys, we got him”
Texas Stark
This guy was born for &quot;TONY STARK&quot; 😂😂!!
dude
It&#39;s amazing that all he needed to do was stop stuttering and looking away to really polish up the character
if Tom Cruise played as Iron man, the whole Avengers gonna turned into Mission Impossible or Top Gun, where Tom matters the most, the rest are just side actors and not important.
:<a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/KsIfY6LzFoLM6AKanYDQAg"></a>
:oops:
Tony is that you??? Or rdj 😂its confusing
The directors were really like we want you to do Exactly this but LOUDER
dialogue is actually smooth, whoever writes Starks lines is genius
Ok, Im going to rewatch Iron Man ...now!
You can tell just how much they polished the script between this and the theatre version
that was the moment tony stark became marvel jesus<br><br>bravo favreau
Robert Downey Jr wore the Iron Man helmet, should drop the Doctor Doom Helmet, grab the keys, suit up (not in the armor but in the coat and shirt) start the JB700 and rev away.
This is iron man
Nailed it
Literally casting RDJ that day changed the whole trajectory of our lives.
Ai generated
- hi im Robe--<br>- accepted
And the rest is history
this is not an audition, it&#39;s a test, you can read it at the start on the ciak
Tony Stark acting like RDJ 😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfdXFbB-1oo&amp;t=253">4:13</a> is that Sharif Atkins? White Collar’s CJ?
of course they chose him - he sounds just like iron man
He&#39;s making a few more expressions between statements here. A bit of his theater training is coming out, more facial expressions, more body shifting and movements, also I assume he must have been nervous. But you can see the gold in there, his speech draws you in, he is charismatic without trying so much, and he sounds smart. I have a hard time picture other actor trying to convey these traits with such style.
even Stan Lee once said: &quot;this gentleman was born to play Tony Stark and the way he looks is exactly the way i pictured him&quot;.
People say acting is easy but it&#39;s the idea of making a conversation look normal and real to life on camera along with being spontaneous when improvising
“Not a woman in sight. I’m a woman. YES.! Clearly.”😂😂
I want to see the audition of him as Dr.Doom
What year is this
Man, I hope he gets the part. Fingers crossed 🤞
His test footage looks very down-played. Like he couldn&#39;t have been any less bothered to play it.
This audition reminded me of his aura<br>And aura reminded me of Denial Day Lewis
he’s him bro
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfdXFbB-1oo&amp;t=266">4:26</a> kenye west??
Who was the actress? She was good too
Charm oozing out of him. Of course he got the job.
Is it just me or Robert Downey Jr has a bit of resemblance to Al Pacino in this act
He has George Clooney vibes in here
And the rest is History
Already played by AI back then. Dead eyes, check
Nailed it👍
Discombobulate
Just dropped a banger on my page , will somebody lmk if they fw it ? 💜🤘🏼
Слишком самоуверенный и наглый. Может это и хорошая версия Тони Старка пост-нулевого Марвел комикс, но не классического Железного Человека.
That ain’t RDJ, that’s Tony Stark
Tom cruise?
Imagine what iron man would be if it wasn’t him
He’s not Tony Stark… He’s IRONNNN MANNNNN!!!!!
And the rest is history
Imagine a world where RDJ doesn’t pass the audition……
The last dialogue was so intense...
he was born for this role bro. no one could ever play tony stark like RDJ
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfdXFbB-1oo&amp;t=320">5:20</a> sounds like Cap in Civil War....
This was just the first of many auditions. By the time, RDJ added more of his style and flair to Tony Stark and embodied a whole new fan favourite character
🥱🤣
It&#39;s odd seeing the acting here vs when you see it as a movie and don&#39;t think of the acting at all.
Such a talented actor. It&#39;s a shame he&#39;s become a leftist propaganda pushing &quot;shmuck in a suit&quot;.
Why is doctor doom auditioning for the role of Tony stark?
as a wannabe actor / voice actor i hope i can get in before its to late.
nervous much lol
Dude plays the role flawlessly
Girl name?
The chosen one❤
this is found footage of tony stark without the cuts or cinematic angles. its just how youd look around and see a billionaire playboy hitting on a journalist
I can&#39;t believe they made him audition as a white dude for Tropic Thunder.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfdXFbB-1oo&amp;t=85">1:25</a><br>This is iran today.<br>And hamas.<br>And hezbollah.<br><br>Yet the world wants to.. Do nothing about it.
Can see the beginning of the facial hair.
He looks a lot healthier before he turned vegan
he feels like the elon musk if he was morally sound
If there&#39;s anyone who can portray Chester Bennington, I&#39;d vote for RDJ
Is that Agent Jones ?! lol... white collar!!!
Damn! Now i gotta watch the movie again.
Tom Cruise is coming!
Robert Downey jr. is a dude , playing a dude , inside of a metal dude.
Saving MCU since 2008 :)
He sounds half in the bag
Kid.. You got the job!
so did he pass the audition?
He was born for this role 😊🗣️🗣️🔥
Bro really put his all into this audition.
Would be good to see other actors auditioning... for a comparison.
Remember this was Tony at his lowest. This was his last chance to succeed
Hopfully he gets the role he looks good for the role
At the start of the second scene, I thought it was just a conversation. <br>This man is a legend. <br>He is Iron Man.
here we go, I need to watch Iron Man 1 again
&quot;less muscles to smile&quot; is crazy 😂
He recreated ironman you know.
this guy is good. he should be an actor... probably Tony Stark in Iron Man
He had to audition?
The girl with RDJ is Shasha Alexander. Nice 👍
Dr. Doom?😂
Never realized he was such a mouth breather
Terrence Howard will like this video.<a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/KsIfY6LzFoLM6AKanYDQAg"></a>
You can tell he was going rough times while shooting this, but even then he was able to pretend he wasn&#39;t when playing Tony
He had George Clooney vibe on here
THE END SCENE … HE DIDN’T BLINK…
&quot;I&#39;m Iron Man. I Iron Man all over the place until a fox says &quot;what a marvel.&quot; <br><br>&quot;You&#39;re hired&quot;
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfdXFbB-1oo&amp;t=269">4:29</a> ain’t this the guy from white collar? 😂😂
LOOK AT THE MAN&#39;s EYES
It’s strange hearing his voice so low, he definitely got better at that
I think they should cast him as Dr Doom
Wait? the needed more than one test footage? Dude had me at hello
<b>I&#39;m Tony Stark and I approve this video</b>
Is this improv or scripted?
Spoiler alert: He got the role
how much was ADLIB? lol
There&#39;s only one Tony and his name is Robert
One thing I think people fail to see about RDJ is he likes <i>acting.</i> Many know his for Iron Man, and some may recognize the rest of his acting career before and during.<br><br>He&#39;s not Iron Man anymore, so maybe now he can go back to being an actor of different roles.
Tony Stark does a very good job at portraying Robert Downey Jr.
Holy crap he’s good.
His acting is good. He should be an actor.
HE IS PLAYING GEORGE CLOONEY
He kind of has Greg &quot;House&quot; vibes here
Mr mumbles
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfdXFbB-1oo&amp;t=310">5:10</a> the moment where intense eye look he gave gosh its such his thing
Dude was born to be Tony Stark.
Tony Stanks audition for Tony Stark
House but not medical😂😂
Tony Stank rules.
Did anybody else feel like it was not an audition but movie?
This convinces me that, given millions in prost production lighting, make up and sound  - I could be an actor too.
Hopefully they cast him as a Iron Man 🤞 i am sure he will be the face of mcu for a decade and who knows after Iron Man death he might return as Dr doom.
He sounds so dry here, and especially considering that it&#39;s an audition. They directed him really well if this is how he started
screen test, not audition
&quot;Love you 3000&quot; this line 😢🥲
do you know who also auditioned for iron man?
He&#39;s not bad, hope he gets the role
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfdXFbB-1oo&amp;t=281">4:41</a> Kevin Hart
Just imagine if they didn’t pick RDJ as Iron Man
Is he improvising?... he is good!
We are literally witnessing the VERY beginning of the MCU right here...
Okay , Hell Yeah I am going , gonna rewatch  all his movies all over again.
RDJ, born for this
nope. tony stark auditioning for rdj.
Wearing headphones, you can really hear his, almost nervous like shallow breathing in the last clip. RDJ is the MAN!!
from a criminal to one of the greatest actors of all time... what an story
Like a duck to water
He could play Dr. House
He shouldn&#39;t have done that role
Back when you didn&#39;t have to be diverse to get a job.
Yo in the second clip the black guy who says “thank you Mr. Stark” is 100%” Clinton Jones from white collar
300 million old city buy power station ball hydro 600 volts lazer amplification
Did he get the job?
he looks AI when his face moving
They recasted so many spiderman and batman but im sure he is the ONLY IRONMAN
Oh my god - deadpool is Tony’s kid 😮😮😮😮
He was Tony Stark from always.
At that time he was a nobody, a drug addict a loser.<br><br>But a single moment can change everything. 🙏
Yeah, that’s Tony alright
I don&#39;t know, did he get the role?
I hope he gets the role
Meh
wait is that cortana&#39;s voice??
im curious how do they choose actor from audition, is it the face, voice, versatility? i mean, how do they know the actor is suitable for the role? 🤔
He’s going to be an excellent Doom.
He dont read the script the script reads him
I just realised hearing the breath takes some of that confident aura away.
“You rehearsed that, much?” Is a very funny line to include in an audition tape.
I know what scenes they’re doing but the lines are so different
That girl sounds like Courteney Cox
It&#39;s so funny once you notice he wears height-boosting boots how out of proportion he looks standing/walking in frame because his proportions don&#39;t match his height.
I hope he gets the role
This isn&#39;t an audition, this is test footage
He had it from the get go
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfdXFbB-1oo&amp;t=232">3:52</a> wolverine?
May I repost this?
I cant see him in another role lolol
Cool
Actually this is false. He just walked onto set said &quot;i am iron man&quot; and got the job
Hey that&#39;s Sasha Alexander!
He would be very famous if he gets this role
Why Tony Stark play himself
Pretty young back then.
I will put Robert Downey Jr up there with Tom Cruise on his acting abilities.
Hear me out Joseph Quinn playing  RDJ biopic !!!!!
amazing...
il a un air de Al Pacino jeune
I want to see his doctor doom audition now 😆
10/10 HE IS TONY AND TONY IS HE...
What&#39;s creepy about that first scene is I can see the characterization Howard Stark in the future movies.
Mr. Hugh Laurie style))
Is he talking to the actor from White Collar in the last scene?
Did he get the part? I really hope so
He definitely started out decent but figured it out. This is what I call doing your homework
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfdXFbB-1oo&amp;t=205">3:25</a> AUDITION PROVES HE DID WORK HARD FOR THE ROLE, CAN SEE THE DIFFERENCE &amp; CAN FEEL THE CONNECT THOUGH.
I just realised the &quot;father&quot; he was reffering to was himself in Oppenheimer,thats why they gave hin the role?
Not sure what it is, but it almost looks like a deep fake of Al Pacino doing RDJ.
I bet he didn’t audition for doctor doom
back when he had a sense of humor
Exellent audition for Dr Doom.
more plz
Who else even auditioned?
Natural
The legend was born❤
doom audition tape needed
It&#39;s less Marvel-y, bit more serious
Funny how the studio wanted nothing to do with RDJ <br><br>Now Marvel is practically backing a dump truck of cash to this dudes house.
this is the dr doom audition
Guys, call me crazy, but I think he may get that role. Maybe even return in a sequel or two.
His eyes can talk.
Robert Downey<br>Ryan Reynolds<br><br><br>Paul Rudd
Tony said his father helped the Manhattan project, he also played Lewis Strauss in Oppenheimer. 🤯🤯
This actor is spot on! I hope he gets the role 🥹
the world famouse robert druggie jr
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfdXFbB-1oo&amp;t=248">4:08</a> isn&#39;t that Jamie Foxx auditioning with RDJ ? If that&#39;s him, wouldn&#39;t that have been weird ?
A..... Nd the rest is history.... 😌
After this audition this guy is perfect for Doom (Said no one ever 😂)
Before he even spoke I would&#39;ve given him the role. Just the aura alone.
Why is&#39;nt this video going viral yet! It showcases how a legend was forged🥲
Epic !
I assume this is a screentest. Not an audition.
i can see a Victor von Doom
I was expecting a &quot;see ya chump&quot; at the ending, been watching too many spiderman memes
Proof that auditions are just formalities.
dude didn&#39;t even blink
Tony stark audition for Ironman
master before work
This Tony Stark is more comic accurate ...compared to the comical MCU version
The clapper board literally says &#39;screen test&#39;...
it was his las chance in hollywood and he nailed it really  hard
Nailed the role hope he gets the part.
Robert Downey Jr Audition For Dr. Doom please
And thus the MCU was born!
Nailed it.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfdXFbB-1oo&amp;t=98">1:38</a> He&#39;s come full circle, but I don&#39;t remember seeing Howard Stark in Oppenheimer?
the last scene looks like his beard grew in fuller as if fate was picking him as the scene unfolded.
You can kinda hear the anxiety in his voice, but then he BECAME the damn character. What an amazing actor.
yes, she was.
was that sasha alexander? her laugh...
Robert Downey Jr isn&#39;t Tony Stark. Tony Stark is Robert Downey Jr.
People watching that know he&#39;s gonna be doctor doom now ----&gt;
He&#39;s looking like Sheldon Cooper here😂
Goddamn, RDJ really helped us believe that a billionaire could be morally driven.
okay i gotta watch iron man 1 again
The man engaged in that conversation as naturally as can be, scripted or not, RDJ is Tony. Ever since &#39;Back to School&#39; with Rodney Dangerfield, stepping stones for this lightning in a bottle
In the last audition scene, Robert doesn&#39;t blink once.  Now that&#39;s acting!
king of improv imp
background is not real classic marvel
Imagine if after all that, the casting director said, <br>“Nah, sorry. That’s just not what we’re looking for… call up Tom Cruise.”
i thought they picked him out
LOL it almost makes you feel sorry for future generations that gets this row because they&#39;re never going to live up to it.
Yeah, about that &quot;Manhattan Project&quot;......
Daaamn!!
In another multiverse somewhere out there...Clive Owen is Tony Stark/Iron Man
Who else noticed Jones from White Collar
Before he became an Avenger…..
aura
I feel like Iron man should have auditioned for Robert Downey Jr
And the 1st Rhody! before Terrence Howard, and Don Cheadle.
gay
A little bit cheesy, I think he was going for a james bond vibe here but you still see Tony Stark
MAN he was born for that role...
The reason this does not sound like Tony Stark is because RDJ had to build the character.
AL GORE RHYTHM!!!
Dude IS Iron-Man
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfdXFbB-1oo&amp;t=261">4:21</a> IS THAT JOHN BOYEGA ?!?!?!?
Terrence Howard made a terrible mistake suggesting RDJ for Tony.  What was supposed to be a one off secured his spot as the face of Marvel forever.  Hard to see Terrence as Iron Man after this.
That sounds like Sasha Alexanders voice?
bro killed this audition, you can really feel hes nervous though but i cant blame him id be sweating bullets
he&#39;s really good he nailed the audition.....hands down the only ever Robert Downey 🙌🙌🙌🙌
This Downey guy is good, they should sign him up in bigger roles.
This is not an audition. It&#39;s a screen test
Robert Downey Jr. was then later cast as Iron Man and the rest is history | <b>V</b>
That final test scene. That&#39;s some top acting.
And now he&#39;s Victor Von Doom
That fact that it’s was 2006 and they had no idea how big this was going to be it’s just 🤯
....and the rest is history....
Still cannot believe he was Ian in Weird Science. I couldnt believe it.
Meh. Should have got Tom Cruise
Why does it look AI?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfdXFbB-1oo&amp;t=282">4:42</a> ... doesnt blink at all for a while... he is in the ZONE .. nice job
dude, this is uncut. I even have a hard time memorizing the periodic table and they just said like 3 paragraphs lof script without buckle
Terrence Howard fought to get him this shot at his rock bottom, even took a paycut, but when TH needed him the most he ghosted him.  Tells you the character of the man.
He only needed to show up for the audition to get the role.
I can tell he&#39;s stressed. His breathing do hard
You are born to be this sir ❤
never blink
was that Sharif Atkins as Rhodey?
Movies need more of this whole un-cut take stuff, adds so much to the performance when there isn&#39;t distractions in between every sentence and you get to see the gears turning in their head between lines.
that &quot;asshole charm&quot; is really something special
OMG that woman is Sasha Alexander 😍 and of course Mr. Stark.
Bruhhh I&#39;m so glad they dropped the slack jaw smugness
One of the greatest casting choices in history no fucking doubt he is Tony Stark
Audition for Tony Stark? HE IS TONY STARK?! 🗣️
I remember that scene, it was in the movie.
Is that nora allen from CW Flash
he should&#39;ve just told them he&#39;s Tony Stark from the beginning... totally unnecessary audition
Class 😮‍💨
Wow first time he looks nervous
The lady is Sasha Alexander?
What an unbelievable performance
Glad he changed his style of acting this nothing like Tony stark aka RDJ
Tony Stank?
Man the level of acting, just omg. To see this in real time is incredible
HE WAS THEWRONG CHOICE
he was born for this roll
RDJ is so gooooood
I can he really worked through the character from what he presented at the first movie
Man he is good<br>Looking
Tony Stank be playing RDJ
They are one in the same. You don&#39;t know when one stops and the other begins. That is what makes it even so much more intense to see him do this roll. No matter how many times it is.
📢 Next!! jkjk
I wouldn’t have hired him. Didn’t have the suave that RDJ has now
There&#39;s something weird with his lower lip here... almost like his tongue is swollen.
corny stark
its interesting how at this stage he was much more subdued than his performance in the actual films
The fact tom cruise was first chosen to be tony stark
NDL
This is a &quot;SCREEN TEST&quot;! Why do re-posters keep twisting the truth for the views or are woefully ignorant? Usually to test wardrobe, lighting, and product shots. He already had the part; they don&#39;t go to this level of production without knowing who&#39;s going to be playing the role!
He auditioned them
Underrated actor
Hope he gets the role
Hydra and Nazis in MCU.
Guy looks great...give him some classes and he can pull off tony stark character..
Bruh being an actor is wild, they&#39;re just in some random dark warehouse testing out the lines from the movie 💀
Imagine him playing Nolan&#39;s Joker
And rest is history 🙌
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfdXFbB-1oo&amp;t=180">3:00</a> that lean in, he looks like Al Pacino
this feels weird
Dude just don&#39;t blink
“I wanna watch iron man now”
I was always worried about Robert Downey Jr. playing Iron Man before I went into the first movie. I’ve watched Robert his whole career but when I walked out of that first Iron Man, you couldn’t of picked anyone else there is no one else forever. Who’s gonna play Iron Man except Robert Downey Jr.
&quot;Legends born here,<br>Legands made here&quot;👁
do you think he will get this role?
this RDJ guy is good, I think they should cast him as Tony Stark.
06...damn
This audition is so stale to me. There’s just no soul behind it. It’s like night and day compared to his actual performances. Weird.
Why was Tony Stark auditioning to play Tony Stark?
where&#39;s RDJ in this video? can&#39;t find him anywhere.
He used to try being Tony, then he stopped trying and became Tony.
I&#39;m not too familiar with Auditions, so are actors suppose to come up with response on the spot?
Why Tony Stark is pretending to be RDJ🙁🙁
Everyone here saying this is a different take, tone, whatever, it&#39;s not. You are mistaking sound and image quality for performance. The performance is exactly the same.
And because of this ...  I&#39;ll watch Iron Man movies this weekend!
There may be a couple have people that could have pulled off Iron Man. But make no mistake if it wasnt Downey there is no MCU. He just has the ability to make you want to listen to what he&#39;s saying. He has that speech pattern that&#39;s almost like music rhythm when he talks. They offered the part to Clive frickn Owen. Nothing against Owen but if he plays Stark its just another action movie and the MCU dies before it starts.
I kinda lost some respect for him after what he did to Terrence
I am sorry he wasn&#39;t good
I hope he gets the part
He was a genius<br>He was a billionare<br>He was a hero<br>He was an Avenger<br>And most importantly, he was Iron Man<br><br>But now... he will <b>DOOM</b> the world.
You’ll never see the one for Doom.
You can tell he was nervous but he was BORN to play Tony Stark
Who&#39;s the girl 😆
Fact:- They didn’t  audition  rdj. Rdj auditioned  them
sniff sniff... anyone hear it?
It actually hurts to think about the fact that Tom Cruise almost got the role
damn
Tony chiding his hypocritical military friend never gets old.
He&#39;s drake but not 12 year olds
last scene is better than the one in the movie
I wish iron man will release soon
I hope he gets the role!
I just realized how different movies would be if they didn&#39;t edit out the sound of everyone breathing!
He was, is and will always be, Tony fuckin stark!
Robert Down Jr Audition For I̶r̶o̶n̶ m̶a̶n̶  Dr. Doom
Is he doing this before or after sherlock?
This is gonna take off, Mark it.
Tony stark is an as Robert Downey Jr. 💀💀
He is legit soo good man.i swear
I mean RDJ was at his low point during this test. He got the opportunity, and he turned it into a majestic performance. <br><br>One of the greats.
RDJ audition for dr Doom:<br>MCU : we&#39;ll give you anything just come back please
Bro was acting dam I thought was Tony Stark
Went to the audition and be himself.
you guys are all looking over the fact that this guy went to the epstein island.
He was seriously cooking
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfdXFbB-1oo&amp;t=315">5:15</a> <b>&quot;I can make a choice, I can fight for what&#39;s right...&quot;</b> <br>If they included this dialogue, this <b>WHOLE</b> scene actually, it would have been better
Tony stark playing RDJ 😂😂
He wasn’t that lose yet but he mastered it for sure
Wonder if he got the part?🤔I&#39;d think he&#39;d be good.
is that cgi or real?
Ladies and Gentlemen make this man a God!<br><br>2024: His God Of The MCU
Who was she
<a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/DfgfY9LaNdmMq7IPuI2AaA"></a>
This guy is born to play Tony stark
Like he is made for it🗿
w
Whatever he was on, I want some of it.
First he auditioned to Marvel ... now Marvel auditioned to him to return as Dr Doom 😄
great audition for doctor doom
25 September, 2006 and the rest is history. <br><br>Almost became multi-millionaire by portraying Iron Man earning more than $450 Million USD from the MCU.
I mean it’s already great.. but what we got on screen? Oh boy that’s out of this world.
Why does this look like ai
legend
Sometimes... you have to dig to rock bottom to find gold.
I am really curious of how he will play Dr Doom, i cant unsee the iron man in him
Here before it blows up
How handsome he is😮
Damn he was good
That moment changed his entire life
They should really give this man a shot at being Tony Stark. I think he&#39;d be good
Where&#39;s his Dr Doom audition?
Is that Tony Stank?
Nothing just RDJ being himself 🤌🏻
Deadpool and Tony engaged in their verbal warfare would be interesting
No one could ever fit better for Iron man than RDJ and it shows
He is not acting he is Tony.
Honestly idk if he could pull it off, dude kinda gives “Fantastic Villain” vibes though, maybe they can do something with that
He is the one
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfdXFbB-1oo&amp;t=276">4:36</a> sounds like Jamie Foxx. don&#39;t you guys think ? 🤔
I can only imagine Favreau seeing the dailies on this and realizing he struck gold.
Subscribe
I can see him being doom now lowkey
You can hear him inhale through the nose every time.<br><br>Cocaine is a helluva drug.
look who they found to play iron man , tony stark himself
Different tone but he mastered it by the time shooting started!
This ain&#39;t Tony Stark this is Starky Ton.
Why was Tony Stark auditioning to play himself?
That last scenario had me reminisce the PS2 IRON MAN Game. The line delivery is just reminiscent of back then.
He handsome
Cool
Press this button if you really know RDJ from the 1986 film &quot;Back To School&quot;<br><br>👇
even though he had to audition we all know they were gonna give it to him anyway.
What a handsome man ❤
He was Born to do this role.
He’s come so far. This RDJ was truly at the rock bottom of his life.
